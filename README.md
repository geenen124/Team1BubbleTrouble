Bubble Trouble Clone For Software Engineering Methods Course.

-----------------------Runnable------------------------------

A .JAR and a .EXE file are located in the RUNNABLES folder.
Use whichever you want. We didn't make a .APP because it
gave us trouble. Minimum requirements: Java 1.8

---------------------Documentation---------------------------

All documents for previous assignments, gui/audio testing and
some run instructions for eclipse, are located in the
DOCUMENTATION folder.

-------------------------------------------------------------

We hope that you will enjoy the results of our project as
much as we did making it. Have fun!

Cheers,

The team
